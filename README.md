Behold ye scoundrels for I have compiled a complete anthology of the written works of our beloved Skyrim. Using Jsoup I have scraped all the written texts from https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Books where I am compiling them into a collection for your enjoyment. 

Simply compile the code for kotlin under the jvm and enjoy :fire:

Peep the source code.
